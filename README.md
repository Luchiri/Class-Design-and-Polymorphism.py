# Class-Design-and-Polymorphism.py
This repository features two Python programs that help practice key OOP concepts:
- Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class - The Smartphone class allows creation of smartphone objects, with methods for actions like making calls or browsing the internet. An inherited class adds extra functionality for smartphones with cameras.
- Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge - This demonstrates polymorphism by defining move() in both Animal and Vehicle classes, with each subclass overriding it to provide unique behaviour.

## How to Run
- Clone or download the repository.
- Open a terminal and run the scripts.
- Follow the instructions or observe the output in the terminal.
